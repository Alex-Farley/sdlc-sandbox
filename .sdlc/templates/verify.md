## Acceptance criteria and TDD evidence
<!-- For each AC: the test, and the tdd.log entries showing it failed (RED) before the code and
     passed (GREEN) after. A test that was never seen failing is weaker evidence: say so. -->
| AC | Test | RED seen (tdd.log time) | GREEN seen | Result |
|----|------|-------------------------|------------|--------|

## Refactoring done
<!-- What was tidied with tests green, or "none needed". -->

<!-- Files changed that the plan did not list, steps done differently, and why. Or "none". -->

## Evals added
